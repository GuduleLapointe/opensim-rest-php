# OpenSim REST PHP development rules

**Never use code or concepts related to projects consuming this library**, it must be agnostic and work with any project.

## Build

`dev/build.sh` makes what the project distributes into `dist/`, from the committed tree (commit first: the version carries the hash of HEAD, and `.dirty` when files are changed):

- a Debian package, `opensim-rest-php_<version>_all.deb`: the library and the client in `/usr/share/opensim-rest-php`, the command `opensim-rest-cli`; it depends on PHP through apt, no vendor folder;
- a zip, `opensim-rest-php-<version>.zip`: the same files with a `vendor` folder, to unzip and use without composer.

`dev/build.sh deb` or `dev/build.sh zip` makes one. What is distributed is what git tracks (so what `.gitignore` ignores is not there) without what `.distignore` lists, plus the `vendor` folder composer makes without the development tools. The scripts are those of [build-tools](https://github.com/magicoli/build-tools) (`vendor/bin/build-tools`, a development dependency); the project keeps its own `packaging/`: the nfpm definition `opensim-rest-php.yaml`, `build` (the files of the package), `siblings`. It needs nfpm and composer.

`tests/Packaging/check` tries both in a clean container (podman), `PACKAGING=1 vendor/bin/pest` runs it after the build where podman is available. What the container needs is sent to it as a tar stream: `CONTAINER_CONNECTION=name` (a `podman system connection`) runs it on the podman of another machine, `MEMORY=` sets its memory (default 400m); both can be set in `tests/.env` (see `tests/.env.example`), read after the `.env` of the project (bash-tools `read_env`: what the files set wins over the environment of the command).

## Release

One command in each project, in the order of the family (rest-php, engine, helpers, kit), each one completely before the next:

```bash
dev/release.sh          # the whole release, after one question
dev/release.sh status   # what is done and what remains
dev/release.sh beta     # patch|minor|major|stable|dev|alpha|beta|rc|1.2.3-beta.4: see the versions in the README of build-tools
```

It needs the `.env` of the project to say where the apt repository is (`APT_REPO_DIR`, see `.env.example` of build-tools), `gh` (logged in) and `nfpm`, and says what is missing before it does anything. `dev/switch.sh dev|release` does the composer part alone (the projects of the family linked next to this one, or required by version).

## Shell scripts

The scripts of `dev/` are wrappers of build-tools. `tests/Packaging/check` uses the functions of [bash-tools](https://github.com/magicoli/bash-tools) to ask, tell and fail (`log`, `success`, `warning`, `die`, `end`, `yesno`, `require`, `usage`, `read_env`), loaded from `vendor/bin/bash-helpers`: write the new ones the same way, not with their own prompts and `echo`.
